# Redaction-systems

A redaction system using Streamlit and Flask is a web application that allows users to upload documents or text data, automatically detect and redact sensitive or confidential information (such as names, addresses, social security numbers, etc.), and then provide the redacted output to the user. This type of application is often used in industries like legal, healthcare, and government to protect sensitive information in documents.

Here's an overview of how such an application could be built using Streamlit and Flask as the tech stack:

## Tech Stack Components:
1. Streamlit: Streamlit is used to create the user interface and display the application in a web browser. It provides a simple and intuitive way to build web applications with Python.
2. Flask: Flask is used as the backend server to handle file uploads, text processing, and serving the Streamlit app.
