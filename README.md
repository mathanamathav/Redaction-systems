# Redaction-systems

A redaction system using Streamlit and Flask is a web application that allows users to upload documents or text data, automatically detect and redact sensitive or confidential information (such as names, addresses, social security numbers, etc.), and then provide the redacted output to the user. This type of application is often used in industries like legal, healthcare, and government to protect sensitive information in documents.

Here's an overview of how such an application could be built using Streamlit and Flask as the tech stack:

## Tech Stack Components:
1. Streamlit: Streamlit is used to create the user interface and display the application in a web browser. It provides a simple and intuitive way to build web applications with Python.
2. Flask: Flask is used as the backend server to handle file uploads, text processing, and serving the Streamlit app.

## Key Features of the Redaction System:

1. File Upload: Users can upload documents (e.g.,csv file) or plain text input containing sensitive information.

2. Text Processing: The uploaded content is processed to identify and redact sensitive information based on predefined rules or machine learning models. Techniques like named entity recognition (NER) is used to identify entities to redact.

3. Redaction: Sensitive information is replaced with placeholders (e.g., [REDACTED]) to protect the data's confidentiality.

4. Visualization: The redacted document or text is displayed to the user through a Streamlit interface, allowing them to review and download the redacted content.

5. Download: Users can download the redacted document or text for further use
